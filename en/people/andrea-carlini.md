At the early age of six, I started to imagine a world where technology would be a part of our lives. Shortly afterwards, I had the chance to work with an Olivetti M24 computer. That was the moment I understood I wanted to be part of that journey, and I fell in love with it.

I was attending Physics University for nearly a year, when I had to give up my studies for economical reasons. I then entered the working world as a laboratory technician in the Italy's largest chemical industry. It wasn’t something I was craving for, but I kept daydreaming.

Then one day, at the corner of the workplace dining hall, I saw a packing case: it was a VAX. I realized I was the right person in the right place. Informatics and automation technologies were at their start in the industrial world, and I had been thrown into that process (in particular in the analysis, research, and quality assessment departments).

I was working for present LyondellBasell, a society which underwent several take-over and mergers (Himont, Montell, Basell). I dealt with in person activities that ranged from development and implementation to upkeep and backing of a variety of systems (webs and infrastructure included). Together with a small but impressive team, there were demanding but always key users: thanks to this combination, even in crisis period we accomplished our goals.

During my 30 year career, I have had the chance to contribute to the evolution of different typology of systems (LIMS,QMS,CDS,PLMs), as much as technologies allowed it. At first, only at experimental stage and increasingly later on, as much as regulation on management and data security permitted it (GALP, GAMP, FDA 21 CFR 11, ISO 17025 to name but some).

Notwithstanding the true passion I nurse for my job, and how it monopolised my life ever since, I had been lucky to become father. After my first girl trio, it came time for a baby clone of myself, and he constantly reminds me of who I have been and am now, with my virtues and vices. In all of this my wife reigns supreme, by safekeeping my heart when my mind gets lost within technology and informatics; she gives it back to me on the Pindaric way back (way back of the Pindaric trip).

I was keeping up with the digital team from far and with a sceptic attitude, basically because I considered the aim of implementing the national public administration data platform a suicide pact. One day, while updating on the matter, I found out that some profiles were vacant. When my mind came back from one of its daydreams, I found myself into the Digital Transformation Team.
